# Mimic
A Python Micro Service RPC Framework

This is an RPC framework built based on Starlette which should provide 
great performance. The main purpose of this project is for 
me to learn new stuffs and practice. However, if I find out it is fun 
and rewarding working on this project, I will try to make it a production 
ready framework. 

## Functionalities
1. Provide a simple way to register functions as RPCs (of course!).
2. Provide a certain way of certification
3. Provide somewhat managed logging
